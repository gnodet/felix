This directory contains an example of a custom dependency (PathDependency).
This dependency tracks all created files in /tmp and injects them in the PathTracker.add(String path) method ...

The PathDependendency is a low level DM example, but shows how to create any custom dependencies.

To test this sample, start the samples under bndtools, then type:

   g! log info|grep customdep

Then create a "test" file under /tmp:

   $ echo "test" > /tmp/test

Then redisplay logs (your Tracker component has normally been injected with the added file and has been started):

   g! log info|grep customdep

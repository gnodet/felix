The Activator you will find in this bundle registers a ComponentExecutorFactory in the OSGi service
registry to enable parallelism. DependencyManager core will use the Executor returned by the
ComponentExecutorFactory in order to handle components dependencies/lifecycle callbacks
concurrently.

Important note: since we are using the DM API to declare our threadpool, we have to disable
parallelism for our "org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.samples.tpool.ThreadPool" component. 
To do so, we define the following OSGi service property (see the bnd.bnd configuration file):

->

org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.parallelism=!org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.samples.tpool,*

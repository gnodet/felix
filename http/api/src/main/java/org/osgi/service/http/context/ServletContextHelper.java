/**
 * Helper service for a servlet context used by a Http Whiteboard implementation
 * to serve HTTP requests.
 *
 * <p>
 * This service defines methods that the Http Whiteboard Implementation may call
 * to get information for a request when dealing with whiteboard services.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each {@code ServletContextHelper} is registered with a
 * {@link org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard.HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_NAME
 * service property} containing a name to reference by servlets, servlet
 * filters, resources, and listeners. If there is more than one
 * {@code ServletContextHelper} registered with the same context name, the one
 * with the highest service ranking is active, the others are inactive.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A context is registered with the
 * {@link org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard.HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_PATH
 * service property} to define a path under which all services registered with this context are 
 * reachable. If there is more than one {@code ServletContextHelper} registered with the same 
 * path, each duplicate context path is searched by service ranking order according to 
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceReference#compareTo(Object)} until a matching servlet or 
 * resource is found.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Servlets, servlet filters, resources, and listeners services may be
 * {@link org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard.HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_SELECT
 * associated} with a {@code ServletContextHelper} service. If the referenced
 * {@code ServletContextHelper} service does not exist or is currently not
 * active, the whiteboard services for that {@code ServletContextHelper} are not
 * active either.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If no {@code ServletContextHelper} service is associated, that is no
 * {@link org.osgi.service.http.whiteboard.HttpWhiteboardConstants#HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_SELECT
 * HTTP_WHITEBOARD_CONTEXT_SELECT} is configured for a whiteboard service, a
 * default {@code ServletContextHelper} is used.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Those whiteboard services that are associated using the same
 * {@code ServletContextHelper} object will share the same
 * {@code ServletContext} object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The behavior of the methods on the default {@code ServletContextHelper} is
 * defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code getMimeType} - Does not define any customized MIME types for the
 * {@code Content-Type} header in the response, and always returns {@code null}.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code handleSecurity} - Performs implementation-defined authentication
 * on the request.</li>
 * <li>{@code getResource} - Assumes the named resource is in the bundle of the
 * whiteboard service. This method calls the whiteboard service bundle's
 * {@code Bundle.getEntry} method, and returns the appropriate URL to access the
 * resource. On a Java runtime environment that supports permissions, the Http
 * Whiteboard Implementation needs to be granted
 * {@code org.osgi.framework.AdminPermission[*,RESOURCE]}.</li>
 * <li>{@code getResourcePaths} - Assumes that the resources are in the bundle
 * of the whiteboard service. This method calls {@code Bundle.findEntries}
 * method, and returns the found entries. On a Java runtime environment that
 * supports permissions, the Http Whiteboard Implementation needs to be granted
 * {@code org.osgi.framework.AdminPermission[*,RESOURCE]}.</li>
 * <li>{@code getRealPath} - This method returns {@code null}.</li>
 * </ul>

	 * If the request requires authentication and the Authorization header in
	 * the request is missing or not acceptable, then this method should set the

	 * {@link #AUTHENTICATION_TYPE} request attribute to the type of
	 * authentication used, and the {@link #REMOTE_USER} request attribute to
	 * the remote user (request attributes are set using the
